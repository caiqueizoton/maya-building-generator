 # Maya Building Generator

## Introduction

This Python script generates customizable buildings in Autodesk Maya using a GUI for user-friendly adjustments. It allows users to specify the following building attributes:

- **Floor Depth:** Defines the depth of each floor of the building.
- **Floor Width:** Sets the width of each floor.
- **Floor Height:** Specifies the height of each floor.
- **Window Divisions:** Determines the number of windows of each floor.
- **Floor Quantity:** Sets the number of floors in the building.
- **Ground Floor Divisions:** Specifies the number of divisions for the ground floor.
- **Ground Floor Height:** Sets the height of the ground floor.

I developed this project to apply automation principles, using Python, to 3D modeling. Firstly, I followed an excellent tutorial by MH Tutorials ([Link](https://youtu.be/BOmNx2n0j_k)) for the modeling aspect. And throughout the modeling process, I automated each step through scripting.

The key aspect of developing this script was to create code that offers flexibility in customizing attributes while maintaining accurate proportions. As a result, I was able to create a basic blueprint that can be used to generate different types of objects, while preserving a coherent design.

## Installation

No additional dependencies are required besides Autodesk Maya with Python support. For the development of this project, the 2023 version of Maya was used.

## How To Use

1. Open Autodesk Maya.
2. Run the script through Maya's Python script editor.
3. Use the GUI to adjust building parameters.
4. The building model will update in real-time as you adjust the sliders.
